1. [Vi](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html)<br/>
To me, Vi is mandatory to learn because itâ€™s currently the default editor for UNIX Operating System. If you are interested in learning more, I found this website to be quite interesting and easy to understand
2. [Template](https://doit.vlsm.org/003.html)<br/>
For the look of my page, I use a template that was referenced by our lecturer. What's interesting with this template is that the theme is easy to implement to our page and there's a lot of modifiation we can do to spice up the looks of our page.
3. [VirtualBox AIO](https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/)<br/>
This website gave me a full guidelines regarding to what do I need to do in order to set up my VirtualBox, from importing an Operating System to synchronize our OS to a GitHub project. 
4. [Video: What is Debian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEAcYZqTYk8)<br/>
I found this video to be interesting because of how short and informative it was. This video shows how influential Debian is to Linux infrastrucute and how it essentially becomes the grandparents to most of popular Linux-based OS.
