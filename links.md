# WEEK 01
1. [Vi](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html)<br/>
To me, Vi is mandatory to learn because itâ€™s currently the default editor for UNIX Operating System. If you are interested in learning more, I found this website to be quite interesting and easy to understand
2. [Template](https://doit.vlsm.org/003.html)<br/>
For the look of my page, I use a template that was referenced by our lecturer. What's interesting with this template is that the theme is easy to implement to our page and there's a lot of modifiation we can do to spice up the looks of our page.
3. [VirtualBox AIO](https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/)<br/>
This website gave me a full guidelines regarding to what do I need to do in order to set up my VirtualBox, from importing an Operating System to synchronize our OS to a GitHub project. 
4. [Video: What is Debian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEAcYZqTYk8)<br/>
I found this video to be interesting because of how short and informative it was. This video shows how influential Debian is to Linux infrastrucute and how it essentially becomes the grandparents to most of popular Linux-based OS. 

# WEEK 02
1. [Nano](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-nano-text-editor/)<br/>
While working on Assignment #02, I'm curious as to what simple editor I can use to edit my logs and may other files, and I found Nano to be the simplest and easiest editor for Linux. I really encourage you guys to check this out if you are interested.
2. [Using Keys](https://www.howtogeek.com/427982/how-to-encrypt-and-decrypt-files-with-gpg-on-linux/)<br/>
In Assignment #02, one of the key (pun intended) subject we need to learn is cybersecurity. I found some interesting things we can do with this concept, such as encrypt a certain file, singing a certificate for that file, or even accessing your public key. Many of that matter can you find out from this link.
3. [Bash](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/bash-script.php)<br/>
I also learned that we can use bash to compile several commands as a singular file. In this assignment, I find this feature to be helpful speed up the process of verifying some files with SHA256SUM.asc
4. [Video: Experimenting with GPG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEloW5QCvKI)<br/>
In this video, we can find a complete explanation as to how the encryption with gpgp works and how can we do it. I pick this video because I found this to be the clearest explanation of this process and the implementation of it. Also we can actually find the commands in the description of the video.
