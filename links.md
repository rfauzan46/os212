# WEEK 01
1. [Vi](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html)<br/>
To me, Vi is mandatory to learn because itâ€™s currently the default editor for UNIX Operating System. If you are interested in learning more, I found this website to be quite interesting and easy to understand
2. [Template](https://doit.vlsm.org/003.html)<br/>
For the look of my page, I use a template that was referenced by our lecturer. What's interesting with this template is that the theme is easy to implement to our page and there's a lot of modifiation we can do to spice up the looks of our page.
3. [VirtualBox AIO](https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/)<br/>
This website gave me a full guidelines regarding to what do I need to do in order to set up my VirtualBox, from importing an Operating System to synchronize our OS to a GitHub project. 
4. [Video: What is Debian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEAcYZqTYk8)<br/>
I found this video to be interesting because of how short and informative it was. This video shows how influential Debian is to Linux infrastrucute and how it essentially becomes the grandparents to most of popular Linux-based OS. 

# WEEK 02
1. [Nano](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-nano-text-editor/)<br/>
While working on Assignment #02, I'm curious as to what simple editor I can use to edit my logs and may other files, and I found Nano to be the simplest and easiest editor for Linux. I really encourage you guys to check this out if you are interested.
2. [Using Keys](https://www.howtogeek.com/427982/how-to-encrypt-and-decrypt-files-with-gpg-on-linux/)<br/>
In Assignment #02, one of the key (pun intended) subject we need to learn is cybersecurity. I found some interesting things we can do with this concept, such as encrypt a certain file, singing a certificate for that file, or even accessing your public key. Many of that matter can you find out from this link.
3. [Bash](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/bash-script.php)<br/>
I also learned that we can use bash to compile several commands as a singular file. In this assignment, I find this feature to be helpful speed up the process of verifying some files with SHA256SUM.asc
4. [Video: Experimenting with GPG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEloW5QCvKI)<br/>
In this video, we can find a complete explanation as to how the encryption with gpgp works and how can we do it. I pick this video because I found this to be the clearest explanation of this process and the implementation of it. Also we can actually find the commands in the description of the video.

# WEEK 03
1. [C Language](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-language-set-1-introduction/)<br/>
I learn that in this assignment, we will learn a litte about C language, what is it and why do we use this programming language. I often use GeeksForGeeks for my reference to anything related to what I currently learn, so in this situation I decided to use this website to figure out this language.
2. [Mounting](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19455-01/805-7228/6j6q7ueup/index.html)<br/>
In this assignment, one of the task we need to do is to mount the drive we already created. Now we might be confused as to the purpose of this process, and why do we need to do it everytime we reboot the OS. I found this documentation by Oracle to be helpful for answering my curiosities.
3. [Default Format for MKFS](https://medium.com/teknomuslim/penjelasan-file-system-extended-ext-di-linux-jenis-ext2-ext3-ext4-3181d79bb764)<br/>
In the documentation given by our lecturer, it mentions Linux's default system when we run a MKFS command as EXT2. Confused, I tend to research as to why is this format be the default and what makes this format superior than the other formats Linux can access. This link is a research compiled into a easy-to-understand article written by an Indonesian Developer/Blogger on Medium. I really suggests everyone to check his works, especially the one I mentioned.
4. [Video: Linux Directory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42iQKuQodW4)<br/>
Since we learn about memory management in this assignment, I feel like figuring out the directories in Linux is necessary, and I find this video to be quite easy for me to understand with its short and compact explanation.

# WEEK 04
1. [Working with Tarball](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3328840/working-with-tarballs-on-linux.html)<br/>
In this week's assignment, one of the task is to extract a file with .tar file type. I decided to take a look at what is tar and ended up finding out about tarball, which essenially means a process of backing up a group of files and combine it into a singular ile with .tar file type. This article helps me understand more about how this process works. 
2. [What Does Libraries Have Anything To Do with Linux?](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/)<br/>
While we installing new packages , I realized that most of the packages we install on the 2nd package list starts with "lib" which makes me think that this must have something to do with libraries. This article I found was essentially made to make programmers understand how to make their own libraries, but in this article, there are some key points that I believe can potentially help you undesrtand the usage of libraries in Linux. 
3. [What is Paging File in Windows?](https://www.howtogeek.com/126430/htg-explains-what-is-the-windows-page-file-and-should-you-disable-it/)<br/>
In the slides that our lecturer has given, one of the subjects we learn in chpater 9 (Main Memory) is Paging File. While the slides have all the information you might need to know, this article I found explains this topic and give actual example we can actually test. I found this article to be quite helpful to make me understand more about how pagefile works.
4. [Video: Virtual Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlH4-oHnBb8)<br/>
One of the things we learn in memory management is Virtual Memory and its purposes to prevent a program to crash. This video simply explains the actual definition and the use cases of virtual memory.
